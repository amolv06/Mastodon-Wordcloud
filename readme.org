#+TITLE: Mastodon Wordcloud

This is a script to create wordclouds from your Mastodon statuses. It goes through and scrapes the entire history of a Mastodon profile and creates a wordcloud.

The following is an example from [[https://fosstodon.org/@BigEatie][my Mastodon account]].

* Prerequisites

The following python packages are prerequisites to running this script

+ beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
+ matplotlib==3.8.2
+ numpy==1.26.4
+ Pillow==10.2.0
+ Requests==2.31.0
+ tqdm==4.66.1
+ wordcloud==1.9.3

Needless to say you also need Python installed. I've tested this using version 3.11.6, but I imagine it should work with versions older than that.

* Installing and running the script

To run this script clone it into a local directory and =cd= into it. You will need an api key to the server you intend on querying through this script. Then run the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:
python cloud.py [server url] [account name] [api key]
#+END_EXAMPLE

So to create a wordcloud for my own account I would invoke the script like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:
python cloud.py https://fosstodon.org/ bigeatie [api key]
#+END_EXAMPLE
